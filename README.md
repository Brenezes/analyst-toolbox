**Analyst Toolbox** 🧰
======================

### The Essential Toolkit for Data Analysis

**Analyst Toolbox** is a unified collection of automation tools designed to streamline and enhance the workflow of analysis teams. With a simple and user-friendly interface, this toolkit combines three powerful scripts into a single menu, providing efficient solutions for common data processing and analysis tasks.

| Tool                 | What It Does                                                      | Why Use It?                                                                                                        |

| 1\. PittFixer        | Corrects the count of corrosion events in datasets.               | Ensures data accuracy by automatically fixing discrepancies in event counts.                                       |
| 2\. ListMPTVO Concat | Combines multiple files of the same extension into a single file. | Simplifies data aggregation, perfect for merging large volumes of files, such as logs.                             |
| 3\. Near Weld        | Filters anomaly events based on their distance from weld events.  | Essential for pipeline inspection data analysis, allowing you to filter critical data based on proximity to welds. |

> ⏳ *New scripts are under development! Stay tuned for future updates.*

**Installation and Usage** 🚀
-----------------------------

### Prerequisites

-   **Python 3.7+**

-   **Python packages:**  `sqlite3`, `os`, `subprocess`, `sys`.

### How to Set Up

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.

2.  Install the dependencies with a single command:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    ```

3.  Make sure all scripts (`pittfixer.py`, `listmptvoconcat.py`, `near_weld.py`) are in the same directory as `menu.py`.

### How to Run

1.  Launch the main tool in your terminal:

    ```
    python menu.py

    ```

2.  An interactive menu will appear. Simply type the number of the tool you want to use.

    ```
    ============================
    ANALYST TOOLBOX - Main Menu
    ============================
    1. Run PittFixer
    2. Run ListMPTVO Concat
    3. Run Near Weld
    4. Exit
    ============================
    Select an Option:

    ```

3.  Follow the on-screen instructions for each script. For example, for **Near Weld**, you'll enter the database path and the filtering distance.
